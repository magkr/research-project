# Research Project

To run the minimax algorithm on the advanced supply chain example (we list all the available examples in 'examples' below):
```
python3 minimax.py "adv_supply_chain"
```

To run the performance test, you can write
```
python3 minimax.py "test"
```

## Examples
A list of the available examples are given below.  
The examples includes test graphs, a graph for performance tests, and business process examples.  
They can be found in the `Processes` directory.

        # test graphs
        'very_simple'
        'simple_red_blue'
        'simple_application'
        
        # performance test
        'binary'
        
        # business process examples
        'adv_supply_chain'
        'food_delivery_aligned'
        'food_delivery_misaligned'
        'supply_chain_aligned'
        'supply_chain_misaligned' 
        'jeans_retailer'
